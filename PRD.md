# Product Requirements Document: AI Growth Backlog Generator

## Executive Summary

**Product Name:** AI Growth Backlog Generator  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** December 2024  
**Product Manager:** [Your Name]  

### Problem Statement
Growth teams struggle to systematically identify and prioritize conversion rate optimization (CRO) opportunities on landing pages. Manual analysis is time-consuming, subjective, and often misses high-impact opportunities. Teams need an AI-powered tool that can analyze landing page screenshots and generate data-driven, prioritized backlog items based on proven growth UX principles.

### Solution Overview
An AI-driven web application that analyzes landing page screenshots (JPG/PDF) and generates a prioritized backlog of CRO ideas with hypotheses and ICE (Impact, Confidence, Effort) scoring. The tool leverages computer vision, growth UX best practices, and machine learning to provide actionable insights for conversion optimization.
